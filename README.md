# astrodynamics

Collection of astrodynamics functions for use in my personal projects.

Won't be uploading it to the Python Package Index as it is for personal use

## Download and Installation

Releases can be obtained from the "releases" section on the sidebar. To install, open a command prompt in the same folder where setup.py is located. Then run this command:

```
pip install .
```

NumPy is required and will be installed if it isn't already.
